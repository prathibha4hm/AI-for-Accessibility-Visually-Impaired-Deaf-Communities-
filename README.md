****AI for Accessibility: Empowering the Visually Impaired & Deaf Communities**

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing accessibility, enabling individuals with disabilities to interact with technology in more intuitive and efficient ways. Our **AI for Accessibility** project is designed to support the **visually impaired and deaf communities** by integrating both **software and hardware solutions** to enhance their independence and quality of life.

**Project Overview**

This project combines **AI-driven software applications** with an **ESP32-based hardware prototype** to provide real-time assistance in communication, navigation, and object recognition.

- **Software Solutions**:
  - **AI-powered voice and gesture recognition** to facilitate communication for deaf individuals.
  - **Computer vision and NLP-based text-to-speech and speech-to-text systems** for better interaction.
  - **Smartphone and web applications** that enable accessibility features such as real-time captions and audio descriptions.
- **Hardware Solutions**:
  - **ESP32-based smart wearable device** that detects objects, obstacles, and text using AI-powered image processing.
  - **Haptic feedback and voice alerts** to guide visually impaired individuals in their surroundings.
  - **Wireless connectivity and IoT integration** for real-time data processing and user interaction.

**Objective & Impact**

By combining **software intelligence with hardware innovation**, this project aims to create an **inclusive assistive system** that empowers individuals with visual and hearing impairments. The goal is to provide them with **greater independence, improved communication, and enhanced safety**, making everyday tasks more accessible and convenient.

With AI-driven accessibility solutions, we envision a world where **technology bridges the gap** between disabilities and opportunities, enabling everyone to thrive equally.
